        <h1> I'm Francis Zavier Ngannou</h1>
        <p>I was born 5 September 1986, I'm a Cameroonian mixed martial artist, I'm currently competes in the heavyweight division for the Ultimate Fighting 
            Championship (UFC), where I'm the reigning UFC Heavyweight Champion. I'm known for being the hardest recorded puncher in the world.
             As of November 2, 2021, I'm #4 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.
             I'm a founder of Francis N'gannou Foundation

    <div class="intro intro_1">
        <h1>My Mission</h1>
        <p> honored to be building the first fully equipped gym in Cameroon. Aspire to provide the chance to fight for good and open doors to a life
             unexpected. The Francis Ngannou Foundation is a non-profit organization created to enable the youth of Cameroon to take action in ways that make a 
             significant, positive difference in their lives.   
        </p>
        <p>
            By daring to dream, Francis knows firsthand the impact that combats sports can have on one's outlook- and outcome. Wanting to provide the same 
            opportunity given to him for those in his hometown, the Francis Ngannou Foundation was formed. Using the beauty of combat sports and teaching the
             principles of respect and discipline, we aim to arm these children with the skills to expand their horizons and realize their dreams.
        </p>

        <h1>
            My Why
        </h1>
        <p>
            Training, fellowship, and team-building go hand-in-hand in the world of combat sports. We work toward providing top-notch facilities where we can 
            work with the children of Cameroon in pursuing their dreams through a holistic coaching experience. This is a chance to create change through the 
            discipline of sport and unity of a team. We know the importance of having access to a safe space and community where trainees can begin to discover 
            and improve their skills while learning the fundamental lessons of sportsmanship.

            With the enormous popularity and reach of combat sports like Judo, Boxing, Karate, MMA, and Kickboxing- we envision our trainees expanding their worldview and
           gaining the opportunity to explore the world, tap into their strengths, and achieve their greatest.
